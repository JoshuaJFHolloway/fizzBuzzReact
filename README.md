# Javascript React Fizzbuzz

To help me get to grips with JS React I have decided to implement it in the old trustworthy Fizzbuzz.
The aim is to render images labelled Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz, or the number itself to further understand how React works.

## Future improvements

I look to create an interface whereby the user can enter in a number and have the code create an image labelled
according to the FizzBuzz protocol. Perhaps even have different images to represent Fizz, Buzz etc.
